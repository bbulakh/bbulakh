# Bogdan Bulakh üë®‚Äçüé§

Hi, I'm Bogdan Bulakh. I'm a 23-year-old frontend developer trainee from Russia with a passion for design and project management.

I've worked on projects in design, marketing and project management for the past 4 years. Now I'm studying frontend at Solvery.io so that I can do some really cool tech projects!
